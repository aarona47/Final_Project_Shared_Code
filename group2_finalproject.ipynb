#Can everyone come and type your name in the line above just so that we can know that everyone knows how to edit this Jupyter Notebook!

#Make sure to install these in terminal before running
# e.g. pip install Py, pip install PyTorch, etc.
#Notes for starting via the CustomVision tutorial imageupload.ipynb - Juliette
#copy the util.py and azurepy.py files to the Final Project Folder in VS Code via the terminal (move local files from one directory to the next)
# first move to the directory you want to copy files to then input this code in the terminal: /<full pathname to file>/util.py . 
#now in the jupyter notebook for the final project input and run the following code (I used the yolov5 kernal to run this) 

%pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision scikit-learn scikit-image
