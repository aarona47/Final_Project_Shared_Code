#Make sure to install these in terminal before running
# e.g. pip install Py, pip install PyTorch, etc.

#copy the util.py and azurepy.py files to the Final Project Folder in VS Code via the terminal (move local files from one directory to the next)
# first move to the directory you want to copy files to then input this code in the terminal: /<full pathname to file>/util.py . 
#now in the jupyter notebook for the final project input and run the following code (I used the yolov5 kernal to run this)

#Creating molecule identification via object detection

#Created object detection using ImageJ before running perforance analysis
#Labeled images in IamgeJ, split up labeling between group members - possible error: differences in how group members labled defects
#Create labels folder in mos2 folder and run performance analysis
